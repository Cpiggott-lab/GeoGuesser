GeoGuesser
A browser-based game made to help people work on their memory recall, typing speed, and most importantly — geography.

In today’s world, it’s all too easy to rely on Google or AI as a second brain. As a father, that realization hit a little harder. I wanted something simple, clean, and fun — a way to challenge focus and knowledge without distractions.

This project started with one intention:

To build a game my son could play — and learn from.

Whether you're here to test your map skills, push your recall under pressure, or just kill a few minutes in a meaningful way, I hope you enjoy this little project.

What it Does
You’re shown a location marker on a world map.
Type the country name as fast and accurately as you can.
You’ve got 2 minutes. Each correct answer is worth 100 points.
High scores are saved locally in your browser (so you can come back and try to beat your best).
When the timer runs out, your final score and the leaderboard appear.
How to Play
Clone the repo or just open the HTML file.
Enter your name, hit Play.
Guess countries by typing their name and pressing Enter or clicking Submit.
When the game ends, you’ll see your score and the top scores so far.
That’s it. No installs, no setup, no bloat.

What’s Inside
Written in vanilla JavaScript using class-based structure
LocalStorage for high score tracking
Clean UI built with HTML and CSS
Fully keyboard accessible
Planned Features
Add actual coordinates for more countries
Clean restart (no page reload needed)
Responsive layout for phones and tablets
Why I Made This
As a dad, I think a lot about what tools and habits my kid will grow up with. I wanted to build something where improvement is visible, effort is rewarded, and learning doesn’t feel like a chore. GeoGuesser is just a first step — but it’s something I’m proud of.

Thanks for checking it out.
